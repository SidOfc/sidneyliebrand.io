Lately I've been getting more and more annoyed by the way Medium decides to do things.
Some time ago they decided to [make everything premium](https://medium.com/membership), so after reading 5 stories you'd be greeted
with something like:

<Image
    src="/media/posts/reader-paywall.jpg"
    alt="The reader paywall message on medium that appears after 5 posts"
    width="1448"
    height="864"
/>

While this sucks, it's not uncommon for "premium" content to be paywalled. My problem
with this setup is that I do not consider my content "premium" at all.

I'm not saying that I think my posts are bad, but rather that I want _everyone_ to be able to take
an unobstructed stroll through my list of posts and read whatever they like, any amount of times they
like. All without asking for a single penny.

Medium however, does not care about anything that is "free" or "open" at all. Seeing as every time I
open one of my stories on Medium, the following message appears at the top:

<Image
    src="/media/posts/metered-paywall.png"
    alt="The metered paywall message on medium"
    width="872"
    height="112"
/>

# "Only you can see this message"

At first, I tried to close the popup. But of course, I should have known that it would not be that simple,
seeing as they are trying to get me to make my stories paid so they can benefit too.

<Image
    src="/media/posts/metered-paywall-never-closing.gif"
    alt="Re-appearing message across page reloads"
    width="1531"
    height="482"
/>

Medium really seems to want authors to read this message I guess. Since after reloading the page, the message re-appears,
**every. single. time.** After trying to ignore it for a while, this popup started getting
under my skin. I decided to [learn some more](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018834334) and found _one_ barely
two-line paragraph of text that caught my eye:

> Stories that are not part of the paywall will only be distributed to your followers,
> and are not eligible to earn money.

So just because I do not want to make my stories part of a paywall, they aren't shared to anyone except my followers? Hmmn...

# Time for a change

Being fed up with Medium tripping over its own ego, it is time for a change.
Having my own website now means that I am no longer bound by some platform
that forces or annoys me to do their bidding, refusing to share my stories otherwise.

I enjoyed what Medium stood for in the past, but in the present it has become just another casual
pay-2-view website.

This is why I decided to unsub from Medium. The content that exists there will stay and
all new content that I post here will have a link shared on Medium for those who follow me.

Enjoy reading ad-, tracker-, and subscription-free on my website, forever.
